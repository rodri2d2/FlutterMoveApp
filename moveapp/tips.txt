  copyWith
  --------
  Let's say you have an object in which you want to change some properties.
  One way to do is by changing each property at a time like object.prop1 = x object.prop2 = y and so on.
  This will go cumbersome if you have more than few properties to change.
  Then copyWith method comes handy.
  This method takes all the properties(which need to change) and their corresponding values and returns new object with your desired properties.
  updateWith method is doing same thing by again calling copyWith method and at the end it is pushing returned object to stream.


   doble.infinity()
   ----------------
   If it is used on a WITH property it means that will take the whole with

    SliverWidget
    -------------
    They are widget with a scroll behaviour.
    A CustomScrollView lets you supply slivers directly to create various scrolling effects,
    such as lists, grids, and expanding headers. For example, to create a scroll view that contains
    an expanding app bar followed by a list and a grid, use a list of three slivers:
    SliverAppBar, SliverList, and SliverGrid.
