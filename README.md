# Flutter Movie App
A simple Movie Data Base that allows the user to see last added movies, most popular ones and search to for a title.

<br />

This app is part of a tutorial on how to make API request on Flutter.
I will of course, adapt this code to my style and try to do as much as I can by myself.
This tutorial is part of my learning path on Flutter framework. Due to its level and the final product, once I finish it I will be able to create and translate my current apps already made with Swift to Flutter.
